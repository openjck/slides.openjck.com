## Slide 1

* Hey everyone
* I'm John Karahalis
* You can reach me at my website
* I manage the Mozilla Dev Derby and want to talk a little about it
* First, let's take a look
* [pull it up]

## Slide 2

* So What is the Dev Derby
* Monthly web development contest
* Highlight a different technology every month
    * To compete in a contest, your demo needs to use the technology of that month
    * This month: [gold topic]
    * After that: [silver topic]
    * And finally: [bronze topic]
* We announce the winners on Hacks
    * Within about a month
    * If you don't know about Hacks, you should
    * Our blog for web developers
* Advocate for the open web
    * Has anyone heard of Chrome Experiments?
    * Site similar to the Derby
    * Gives developers a chance to show the world what they can do with *Chrome*
    * Dev Derby is a response to that
        * You don't need Chrome to have amazing experiences on the web
        * Think about mobile
            * You don't need to learn how to write Android apps to create real native-like experiences
            * You don't need to learn how to write iOS apps to create real native-like experiences
            * You don't need to learn Java to make use of a mobile phone's camera
            * You don't need to learn Objective C to build apps that are sensitive to orientation
            * You can do all those amazing things with just *the web* -- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* And as I said, this is about *the web*, not just Firefox.
    * Most demos submitted work in multiple browsers, and we think that's great.

## Slide 3

* Some examples!
* SnappyTree was a recent winner
    * Incredibly powerful. Real 3D design on the web.
    * You can even export the trees you create for desktop applications
    * A little addicting. Who knew.
* The Face Builder
    * Fun little game
    * On mobile, supports touch to move the pieces around
    * Even supports multitouch to change the angle of the pieces. Remember -- this is just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript!
* HTML5 Audio Read-Along
    * Really interesting. Simple but powerful.
    * Supports skipping
    * Supports clicking on words
    * You can imagine some real world applications here
* HTML5 Trombone
    * A trombone that you play by resizing the browser window
    * By the way, check out Responsive Design View
    * You can even play real songs on it!
* Santa's Media Queries
    * [demo it]
    * One of my favorites. Why?
    * Awesome demo. Really creative. Only 71 lines of code.
    * You don't really need to do much to do something really, really creative

## Slide 4

* But it's only for experts, right?

## Slide 5

* Wrong!

## Slide 6

* Many winners tell me they knew nothing about the monthly topic before starting
* Six out of eight of the most recent winners -- 75% -- had never competed in the Derby before
* We always have a beginner-friendly introduction on the Derby homepage
    * If you would like more background than what we provide, no problem
    * Just grab me today or contact me via email -- again, that's on my site

## Slide 7

* Why participate?

# Slide 8

* Prizes!

# Slide 9

* First place wins a Samsung Galaxy S III
    * One of the best phones on the market right now
* Second place wins a Rickshaw laptop bag
    * Probably the best laptop bags you can buy
    * Really, really solid
* Third place wins this awesome Dev Derby t-shirt
* Woo prizes!

# Slide 10

* BUT!

# Slide 11

# Slide 13

* Another one, after I mentioned the prize to our first place winner
* [Read]

## Slide 14

* So why do these people participate if they don't know what the prizes are
* From my discussions with winners, three things
* Education
    * The Dev Derby is a great way to learn about new technologies.
    * A monthly challenge that you can rise up to!
    * If you participated in every Derby -- one demo per month...
        * You will improve your skills in ways you couldn't even imagine
        * Your resume will be incredibly strong
        * You will be a much better web developer, *and* it will be fun.
        * I really mean that.
* Pushing the web forward
    * Show the world that we can build things that
        * Work anywhere
        * On any device
        * Still provide amazing, native-like experiences
* Finally, exposure
    * Many of our contributors -- not always winners -- have become famous for their work
    * Here's one from reddit
    * Another demo became really popular on Hacker News
    * And this guy's library -- he created a demo using it -- got over a thousand followers on GitHub
    * Mozilla Hacks. I always do an interview with the winner.
    * At least two (that I know of) employees went on to get a job with Mozilla
        * And at least one other person I know interviewed
    * And that's just a couple of examples
* And we do have the real prizes, if you care about stuff like that
* So plenty of reasons to be excited

## Slide 15

* Rules
* Contest ends on the last day of the month
* Groups and Mozilla employees are not eligible.
    * Probably nobody here is an employee
    * Groups
        * That doesn't mean don't talk
        * It doesn't mean don't share ideas
        * If a group can claim ownership, submit to Demo Studio instead
            * Same thing, same benefits, just no prizes
    * Just about giving everyone an even playing field for the purpose of the contest

## Slide 16

* So that's it... that's all I've got.
* Any questions?

## Slide 17

* Alright, thanks and have fun!
