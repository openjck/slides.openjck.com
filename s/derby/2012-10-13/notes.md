## Slide 1

* I'm John Karahalis
* I manage the Mozilla Dev Derby
* You can reach me through my website, listed at the bottom-right down there

## Slide 2

* So what is the Dev Derby?
* [pull it up]
* To sum it up, it's a monthly web development contest.
* We have a new topic every month.
    * To compete in a contest, your demo needs use the technology of that month
    * This month we have CSS Media Queries
    * After that we have the Full Screen API, also very cool
    * And then finally, in December, we have offline technologies
    * After that, we will probably something related to WebRTC. Stay tuned!
* The Dev Derby is an advocate for the open web
    * Has anyone heard of Chrome Experiments?
    * It's a site similar to the Dev Derby, but for showing the world what you can do with *Chrome*.
    * The Dev Derby is, in a way, a response to that.
        * We want to say, you don't need Chrome to have an amazing experiences.
        * You don't need the walled gardens of native phone environments to have amazing experiences.
        * You can do all of these amazing things just using *the web*. And that's what we're all about.
    * So most of the demos submitted to the Derby do work in multiple browsers. And those that don't, really should.

## Slide 3

* So some examples!
* SnappyTree was a recent winner
    * Incredibly powerful -- this is real 3D design on the web
    * You can actually export these trees to use them in real desktop programs
    * And... believe it or not, it's a little addicting. Who knew?
* HTML5 Audio Read-Along
    * Really interesting
    * You can imagine some real world applications here
* Santa's Media Queries
    * Really interesting use of CSS Media Queries
    * This whole thing is only probably about 100 lines of code
    * So you don't need to do much to make something really, really creative

## Slide 4

* Why participate?
* Prizes!
    * First place wins an Android phone
    * Second place wins a Rickshaw laptop bag
    * Third place wins an MDN t-shirt
* Woo prizes!
* But...

## Slide 5

* No one cares about the prizes.
* What follows are actual, verbatim quotes from Dev Derby winners...

## Slide 6

* [Read it out loud]

## Slide 7

* [Read it out loud]
* [facepalm]

## Slide 8

* So why do people participate? What are the real rewards?
* From my discussions with winners, it comes down to three things.
* Education
    * The Dev Derby is a great way to learn about new technologies.
    * A monthly challenge that you can rise up to!
    * If you participated in every Derby -- one demo per month...
        * You will improve your skills in ways you couldn't even imagine
        * Your resume will be a force to be reconed with
        * You will be a much better web developer, **and** it will be fun.
        * I really mean that.
* Exposure
    * Many of our contributors -- not always winners -- have become famous for their work
    * A great demo called "The Box" became the number result in the Web Design subreddit a while back
    * Here's another demo that did really well on Hacker News
    * And that's just a couple of examples
* And the final benefit I hear from our contributors, pushing the web forward
    * Again, showing the world that we can create things that work anywhere, on any device, and still provide amazing, native-like experiences.
* So plenty of reasons to get involved

## Slide 9

* But I need to be an expert to participate!
* Wrong!
* We always have beginner-friendly introductions on the Dev Derby homepage
    * And if that's not enough, just shoot me an email
    * Again you can get that contact info on my website
* Many of the winners I talk to tell me they knew nothing about the topic before starting
* Five out of seven of our most recent winners -- more than 70%! -- had never competed in the Dev Derby before!

## Slide 10

* So... rules.
* Yes I know, we have to.
* Do not republish your demos without the expressed written consent of the NFL
* No, much more simple than that
    * Submit your demo before 11:59pm Pacific Time on the last day of the month
    * If you work at Mozilla, you are unfortunately not eligible to win the contest
    * Group demos are not elligible
        * What do I mean by this?
        * So... we don't want to stop you from talking to others
        * We don't want to stop you from learning from others
        * But if you want to work with someone else, if it really is a group effort, please submit your demo to our sister site, the Demo Studio.
        * The point is not to punish you, it's just that we want to be sure everyone is on an equal playing ground when it comes to the contest.
    * And finally, see the "Rules" tab of the Dev Derby website and the submission guidelines before you start. You can get to the submission guidelines by logging in and clicking "Submit your demo".

## Slide 11

* A couple of more things before we get into questions...
* The finalists, winners, and prizes will be announced next month, around the 20th, on our Hacks blog
    * [pull up hacks blog]
* But no one cares about them anyway
* I'm kidding.
    * To thank you guys, we do have a couple of prizes to hand out at the end.
    * Many thanks to Lucy for that.
* If you guys want, you can present your work later this afternoon -- maybe some time around 4:30
* And while you're working, please feel free to help yourself to snacks, drinks, make yourself at home.
* So that's it... that's all I've got.
* Any questions?

## Slide 12

* Alright, if there are no more questions... good luck and have fun!
* I'll be around to answer any other questions you have.
* So don't be afraid to flag me down.
* Thanks!
